# Natural Language Processing #
A collection of notebooks for projects focused on natural language processing problems. They make opinionated use of TensorFlow (particularly its Keras API) to create Embeddings Layers and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). They rely on openenly available data so that they can be easily reproduced.

## Overview ##
The following is a brief summary of the projects available. 
* __Word embedding__: creates an embedding for a sentiment classification task which can be visualized in Embedding Projector. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values that are the weights learned by the model during training. In this example the embedding is built against the openly available IMDbÂ movie review dataset.

## Future work ##
Use pre-trained [GloVe word embedding vectors](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) to improve sentiment detection on the IMDb movie review dataset.
